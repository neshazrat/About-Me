         <h3> <b> <u> Why UX Design? </u> </b> </h3>
      </center>
      <p> My interest in UX design stems from my strong innovation and problem solving skills. Taking A level Mathematics and Computer Science allows me to be challenged every day with a new problem. It demonstrates my ability to solve problems, think critically and analyse tasks. On the other hand, Product Design also allows me to solve problems but by using innovaiton. The task of solving a specific problem demanded by a client and being able to serve them a solution or product which is satisfactory is what I love about the subject.  The practical aspects of Product design and Computer Science allow me to have hands on experience in developing and manufacturing.</p>

         <h3> <b> <u> Why Technology? </u> </b> </h3>
      </center>
      <p> As a 17-year-old girl, I chose to pursue technology because I want to challenge the stereotypes that suggest it isn’t a space for women. The field presents constant challenges, and I thrive on problem-solving and pushing myself to overcome them. My determination to grow, learn, and prove what’s possible motivates me to build a future in technology.</p>
